                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My name is Ashley and I am from Texas! I am a wife and mother to Michael and Keighton. I have a degree in Design Communications and have always loved design. In College I had to take a Web Developement class and I loved it so much.  I never went any further with my developemnt classes after I graduated. I was offered a job at a large school district as their graphic designer, so I did more print than web. </p>

                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p> Around 2014 I began to take classes from Treehouse and more recently Skillcrush. I have been brushing up on my skills and learning new things to be able to make a full switch to front-end developement. I look forward to using my design skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.   </p>

                        <h3>HTML &amp; CSS</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                        <h3>Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign</h3>
                        <p>I'm able to design print material or web design. I also can take other designers PSD files and covert them into an amazing webpage</p >
